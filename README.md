## Description

* Project created by Ujjawal Poonia as part of the Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree.

## Project Instructions

In this project, a static webpage that lacks accessibility is given to be converted into a mobile-ready web application. The design  must be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. It will also be added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for the users.

## Run the Application

In order to run the application you have some options:

1. Open it [here](https://ujjawalponia.github.io/restaurant-reviews-app-one/)

2. Run it localy
* Download as .zip file or clone this project:

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/ujjawalponia/restaurant-reviews-app-one.git
    ```

* In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

* In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

* With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
